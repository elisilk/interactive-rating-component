## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Fluid typography and spacing

### What I learned

Hmm ðŸ¤” ...

### Continued development

Hmm ðŸ¤” ...

Specific areas that the solution should be improved (known issues):

- Block and inline spacing within each of the two screens. In general, it seems like the block spacing between the heading and the text content should be smaller than the block spacing between other elements on each screen. Maybe they (the headings + text) should be in a container to represent that they are connected?

More general ideas I want to consider:

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs for CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Went here a lot to reference the different CSS properties and the shorthands, and all the great explanations about best practices.
- [MDN Guides](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) - [The Clamp Calculator](https://royalfig.github.io/fluid-typography-calculator/) - Used for all of fluid typography and fluid spacing calculations.
